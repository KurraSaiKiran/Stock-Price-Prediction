## 🧠 LSTM Model Deep Dive

### Architecture Overview
- **Input Layer**: Processes sequential stock price data
- **LSTM Layers**: Captures temporal dependencies and patterns
- **Dense Layers**: Final prediction output
- **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting

### Training Strategy
- **Sliding Window Approach**: Uses historical data to predict future values
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporates technical indicators
- **Normalization**: Ensures stable training process
- **Validation**: Rigorous testing on unseen data

### Model Performance
The model achieves competitive accuracy on historical data, with continuous improvements through:
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Feature selection
- Architecture refinement

## 📈 Usage Examples

```python
# Load and preprocess data
data = load_stock_data('your_data.csv')
processed_data = preprocess_data(data)

# Load trained model
model = load_model('stock_price_model.h5')

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(processed_data)
```
