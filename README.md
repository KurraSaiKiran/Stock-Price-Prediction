ðŸš€ Project Motivation

Stock market forecasting is a challenging task due to its volatile nature. However, with the power of deep learning and historical data, it's possible to build models that can uncover hidden trends and assist investors in making informed decisions.

This project was developed to:

Learn practical implementation of LSTM for time-series prediction

Build a user-friendly prediction tool

Gain experience in deploying machine learning models in an app

ðŸ§  Tech Stack
Python 3

TensorFlow / Keras â€“ For building the LSTM model

Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ Visualization

Streamlit or Flask â€“ Frontend for user interaction

H5 File â€“ Saved model file

ðŸ“‰ LSTM Model Overview
The LSTM model is trained on historical closing prices.

It uses a sliding window approach to forecast the next value.

Performance can be improved by adding technical indicators, more data, or tuning hyperparameters.



âœ… Future Improvements
Integrate with live stock APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)

Add feature for multiple stock symbols

Enhance UI with more interactivity

Add model performance metrics like RMSE, MAE
